The Meeting Summariser is an AI-driven application designed to streamline the process of capturing and understanding discussions conducted in online meetings. 
This tool enables users to record live meeting audio, transcribe recorded speech into text, and automatically generate concise summaries using transformer-based natural language processing models.
In addition to summarisation, the system provides sentiment analysis and keyword extraction to offer deeper insights into the meeting content.
The application is built with an intuitive Streamlit interface, making it accessible for individuals, teams, and organisations seeking to enhance productivity and documentation accuracy during virtual meetings.
